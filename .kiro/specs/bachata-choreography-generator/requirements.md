# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Bachata Choreography Generator is a web-based application that automatically creates authentic dance sequences for couples based on a Bachata song from YouTube. The system analyzes the musical structure and rhythm to select and chain together appropriate dance moves from a collection of 40 pre-recorded video clips (5-15 seconds each, ranging from beginner to advanced). The output is a complete choreographed video that stitches together the selected move clips synchronized to the song's audio, playable directly in the browser.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Bachata dancer, I want to paste a YouTube URL and receive a complete choreographed dance sequence, so that I can learn new combinations that match the music's rhythm and style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pastes a YouTube URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and accessibility
2. WHEN the URL is valid THEN the system SHALL download the audio from the YouTube video
3. WHEN the audio is downloaded THEN the system SHALL analyze the song's tempo, rhythm patterns, and musical structure
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a sequence of dance moves that matches the song's duration
5. WHEN the choreography is generated THEN the system SHALL provide a complete video output by stitching together selected move clips with the original song audio 

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dance instructor, I want the generated choreography to feel authentic and musically appropriate, so that my students can learn proper Bachata technique and musicality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting dance moves THEN the system SHALL choose moves that align with the song's rhythm and musical phrases
2. WHEN transitioning between moves THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth connections that maintain the dance flow
3. WHEN the song has distinct sections (intro, verse, chorus, bridge) THEN the system SHALL adapt the choreography complexity and style accordingly
4. WHEN generating the sequence THEN the system SHALL maintain proper Bachata timing and basic step patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a visual representation of the choreography that I can watch directly in my browser, so that I can follow along and practice the moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the choreography is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a video by stitching together clips from the collection of 40 pre-recorded Bachata moves
2. WHEN creating the video THEN the system SHALL synchronize each move clip to match the corresponding musical section and tempo
3. WHEN stitching clips THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth transitions between moves that maintain visual continuity
4. WHEN the video is ready THEN the system SHALL make it playable directly in the browser with standard video controls
5. WHEN displaying the video THEN the system SHALL show both leader and follower perspectives clearly from the original clips

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the move selection to be based on the collection of 40 pre-recorded Bachata move clips, so that the choreography remains diverse and authentic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load the collection of 40 Bachata move video clips with associated metadata
2. WHEN storing move clips THEN the system SHALL include timing information (5-15 seconds), difficulty level (beginner to advanced), and musical compatibility
3. WHEN selecting moves THEN the system SHALL use embeddings and similarity matching to find clips that best match the song's tempo and musical characteristics
4. WHEN analyzing clips THEN the system SHALL extract features like duration, tempo compatibility, and difficulty level for optimal selection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle different song styles and tempos, so that I can generate choreography for various types of Bachata music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a song THEN the system SHALL detect tempo ranges from slow (90-110 BPM) to fast (130-150 BPM)
2. WHEN the song is traditional Bachata THEN the system SHALL prioritize classic moves and patterns
3. WHEN the song is modern/urban Bachata THEN the system SHALL include contemporary styling and variations
4. WHEN the tempo changes within a song THEN the system SHALL adapt the move selection accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the progress of choreography generation in real-time, so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a YouTube URL THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar showing the current processing stage
2. WHEN downloading audio THEN the system SHALL show progress with status "Downloading audio from YouTube"
3. WHEN analyzing the song THEN the system SHALL show progress with status "Analyzing musical structure and tempo"
4. WHEN selecting moves THEN the system SHALL show progress with status "Selecting and sequencing dance moves"
5. WHEN creating the video THEN the system SHALL show progress with status "Stitching video clips together"
6. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL hide the progress bar and display the playable video

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to customize certain aspects of the choreography, so that it better fits my skill level and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating choreography THEN the system SHALL accept difficulty level preferences (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
2. WHEN the user specifies preferences THEN the system SHALL filter move clips based on complexity and technical requirements
3. WHEN customization options are provided THEN the system SHALL allow selection of focus areas (turns, footwork, sensual styling)
4. IF no preferences are specified THEN the system SHALL default to intermediate level with balanced move variety from the 40 available clips
