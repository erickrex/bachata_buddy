# üéµ Bachata Choreography Generator

An AI-powered system that generates personalized Bachata choreographies by analyzing music characteristics and matching them with appropriate dance moves from a curated video library using advanced machine learning techniques.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Architecture

### Model Overview
The system employs a **multi-modal machine learning pipeline** that combines audio analysis, computer vision, and recommendation algorithms to generate contextually appropriate dance choreographies.

**Core ML Components:**
