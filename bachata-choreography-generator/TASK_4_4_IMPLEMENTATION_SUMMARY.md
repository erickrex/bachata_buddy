# Task 4.4 Implementation Summary: Enhanced Movement Dynamics Analysis

## Overview

Successfully implemented enhanced movement dynamics analysis for the Bachata Choreography Generator as specified in task 4.4. This implementation extends the existing MoveAnalyzer service with advanced movement pattern analysis capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Movement Velocity and Acceleration Patterns
- **Velocity Profile Analysis**: Calculates movement velocity over time from pose sequences
- **Acceleration Profile Analysis**: Computes acceleration patterns from velocity changes
- **Movement Intensity Profiling**: Tracks movement intensity variations throughout the clip
- **Periodicity Detection**: Uses FFT analysis to identify rhythmic patterns in movement

### 2. Spatial Movement Pattern Analysis
- **Footwork Area Coverage**: Calculates the spatial area covered by foot movements using convex hull analysis
- **Upper Body Movement Range**: Measures the range of upper body movement across shoulders, elbows, and wrists
- **Spatial Distribution**: Analyzes movement distribution across different body regions (upper body, lower body, arms, legs)
- **Movement Direction Analysis**: Identifies dominant movement directions (horizontal, vertical, static)

### 3. Rhythm Compatibility Scoring
- **Rhythm Compatibility Score**: Uses autocorrelation analysis to measure rhythmic consistency
- **Movement Periodicity**: Calculates regularity of movement patterns using frequency domain analysis
- **Rhythm Score**: Measures consistency of movement velocity patterns
- **Beat Alignment Analysis**: Analyzes how well movement patterns align with potential musical beats

### 4. Transition Point Identification
- **Acceleration-Based Detection**: Identifies transition points based on significant acceleration changes
- **Velocity Direction Changes**: Detects points where movement direction changes significantly
- **Movement Phase Transitions**: Automatically identifies key transition moments in choreography

### 5. Transition Compatibility Calculation
- **Pose Similarity Matching**: Compares ending pose of one move with starting pose of another
- **Energy Level Compatibility**: Assesses compatibility between different energy levels (low/medium/high)
- **Direction Compatibility**: Evaluates how well movement directions flow between moves
- **Rhythm and Complexity Matching**: Considers rhythm and complexity compatibility for smooth transitions
